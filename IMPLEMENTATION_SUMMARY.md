# Implementation Summary: Three Key Improvements

This document summarizes the implementation of three requested improvements to Xibe Chat.

## 1. Windows Build Support for Multiple Architectures

### Changes Made
- **File**: `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`
- **Update**: Added ARM64 architecture to the Windows build matrix
  - Changed from `arch: [x64]` to `arch: [x64, arm64]`
  - Added intelligent build path detection to handle cross-compilation scenarios
  - Updated artifact packaging to work with both architectures

### Important Notes
- **x86 (32-bit)**: Not included as Flutter officially deprecated 32-bit Windows support
- **ARM64**: Experimental support in Flutter; may build as x64 on GitHub's x64 runners
- Both x64 and ARM64 builds will produce separate ZIP and MSIX artifacts

### Artifacts Produced
- `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v{version}-{build}.zip`
- `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v{version}-{build}.msix`
- `xibe-chat-windows-arm64-v{version}-{build}.zip`
- `xibe-chat-windows-arm64-v{version}-{build}.msix`

## 2. AI Typing Animation

### Changes Made
- **File**: `lib/widgets/message_bubble.dart`
- **Enhancement**: Added a blinking cursor animation during AI response streaming

### Implementation Details
- Converted `MessageBubble` from StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget
- Added `AnimationController` for cursor blinking effect
- Cursor appears at the end of streaming text with smooth fade in/out animation
- Cursor only shows during active streaming (when `isStreaming: true`)
- Animation runs at 530ms per cycle for realistic typewriter effect

### User Experience
- Users now see a blinking cursor "â–ˆ" at the end of AI responses as they stream in
- Provides clear visual feedback that the AI is actively typing
- Cursor disappears once response is complete

## 3. Image Support for Vision-Capable Models

### Changes Made

#### 3.1 Model Detection
- **File**: `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart`
- Added `selectedModelSupportsVision` getter that checks:
  - `model.vision == true` flag
  - `'image'` in `model.inputModalities` array

#### 3.2 Image Picker Integration
- **File**: `lib/widgets/chat_input.dart`
- Added `image_picker` dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
- Added image selection button (camera icon) that only appears when vision model is selected
- Implemented image preview with remove option
- Converts selected images to base64 for API transmission
- Updated send callback to include optional image parameters

#### 3.3 Message Model Updates
- **File**: `lib/models/message.dart`
- Added `imageBase64` field for API transmission
- Added `imagePath` field for local display
- Updated `toApiFormat()` to use OpenAI's multimodal format:
  ```json
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {"type": "text", "text": "..."},
      {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}
    ]
  }
  ```

#### 3.4 Database Schema
- **File**: `lib/services/database_service.dart`
- Upgraded database version from 1 to 2
- Added migration to add `imageBase64` and `imagePath` columns
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

#### 3.5 UI Integration
- **File**: `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`
- Updated both mobile and desktop layouts
- Passes `supportsVision` flag from ChatProvider to ChatInput
- Updated message send callbacks to handle image parameters

#### 3.6 Image Display
- **File**: `lib/widgets/message_bubble.dart`
- Shows attached images in user messages
- Displays image above text content
- Includes error handling for missing/corrupted images
- Images are shown as rounded thumbnails

### Supported Models
Based on the provided model list, these models support vision (image input):
- **gemini** - Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- **gemini-search** - Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite with Google Search
- **openai** - OpenAI GPT-5 Nano
- **openai-audio** - OpenAI GPT-4o Mini Audio Preview
- **openai-fast** - OpenAI GPT-4.1 Nano
- **openai-large** - OpenAI GPT-4.1
- **openai-reasoning** - OpenAI o4 Mini
- **bidara** - NASA's BIDARA
- **evil** - Evil (uncensored)
- **unity** - Unity Unrestricted Agent

When any of these models are selected, users will see an image picker button in the chat input.

### User Workflow
1. User selects a vision-capable model from the dropdown
2. Image picker button (ðŸ“·) appears in chat input
3. User clicks button and selects an image from gallery
4. Image preview appears with option to remove
5. User types a message (optional) and sends
6. Message is sent with both text and image to the API
7. Image is displayed in the chat history with the message

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `image_picker: ^1.0.7` - For selecting images from device gallery

### API Compatibility
- Uses OpenAI-compatible multimodal message format
- The Xibe API endpoint (`https://api.xibe.app`) supports this format
- Images are sent as base64-encoded data URLs

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Version 2 migration
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN imageBase64 TEXT;
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN imagePath TEXT;
```

### Platform Support
- Image picker works on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Desktop platforms show file picker dialog
- Mobile platforms show camera/gallery selection

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Windows Builds**: Trigger workflow with different architectures
2. **Typing Animation**: Send messages to AI and observe cursor blinking
3. **Image Support**:
   - Select a vision model (e.g., gemini, openai)
   - Verify image picker button appears
   - Select an image and send with/without text
   - Verify image displays in message history
   - Test with non-vision models (button should not appear)
   - Test image persistence after app restart

## Future Enhancements

- Add image compression options
- Support multiple images per message
- Add camera capture option (currently gallery only)
- Add image editing capabilities
- Support for audio/video attachments
