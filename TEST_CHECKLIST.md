## 1. Windows Build Architecture Tests

### Test ARM64 Build in Workflow
- [ ] Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub

- [ ] Verify workflow includes both x64 and arm64 builds
- [ ] Check build logs show both architectures
- [ ] Verify artifacts are created for both:
  - [ ] `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v*.zip`
  - [ ] `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v*.msix`
  - [ ] `xibe-chat-windows-arm64-v*.zip`

### Manual Test (if possible on ARM64 device)
- [ ] Download ARM64 build artifact

## 2. Typing Animation Tests

### Basic Animation Test
- [ ] Launch the app

- [ ] **VERIFY**: Message sends successfully
- [ ] Try selecting a corrupt/invalid image file
- [ ] **VERIFY**: App handles gracefully with error message

### Model Switching
- [ ] Select a vision model, add an image
- [ ] Switch to a non-vision model
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Image picker button disappears
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Any selected image is cleared
- [ ] Switch back to vision model
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Image picker button reappears

## 4. Database Migration Test

### First Time After Update
- [ ] If testing on existing installation with old data:
  - [ ] Open the app
  - [ ] **VERIFY**: App opens without errors
  - [ ] **VERIFY**: Existing chats are still accessible
