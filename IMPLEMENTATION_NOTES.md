# Implementation Notes: App Logo & AI Memory System

## Summary of Changes

This implementation adds three major features to the Xibe Chat application:

### 1. App Logo Configuration for All Platforms ✅

**Objective**: Replace the default Flutter logo with the custom Xibe Chat logo across all platforms.

**Implementation**:
- Added `flutter_launcher_icons` package to `pubspec.yaml`
- Configured app icon generation for all platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Generated platform-specific icons:
  - **Android**: ic_launcher.png in all densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
  - **Windows**: app_icon.ico with multiple sizes (16x16 to 256x256)
  - **Linux**: app_icon.png (256x256)
  - **iOS/macOS**: Will be generated during build via flutter_launcher_icons
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate iOS/macOS icons during build
- Updated MSIX configuration to use the custom logo

**Files Modified**:
- `pubspec.yaml`: Added flutter_launcher_icons configuration
- `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`: Added icon generation step to all build jobs
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png`: Generated Android icons
- `windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico`: Generated Windows icon
- `linux/app_icon.png`: Generated Linux icon

### 2. Splash Screen Logo Update ✅

**Objective**: Replace the rotating splash screen icon with the custom Xibe Chat logo (logo-nobg.png).

**Implementation**:
- Modified `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` to use `logo-nobg.png` instead of the default icon
- Maintained the existing rotation and fade animations
- Updated container size to accommodate the logo
- Added logo files to Flutter assets in `pubspec.yaml`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`: Updated to use logo-nobg.png
- `pubspec.yaml`: Added logo.png and logo-nobg.png to assets

### 3. AI Memory System ✅

**Objective**: Implement a long-term memory system where the AI can save and recall important information about the user across conversations.

**Implementation**:

#### Database Layer
- Created `Memory` model in `lib/models/memory.dart`
- Added `memories` table to database schema (version 4)
- Implemented CRUD operations in `DatabaseService`:
  - `insertMemory()`
  - `getAllMemories()`
  - `updateMemory()`
  - `deleteMemory()`

#### Provider Layer
- Extended `SettingsProvider` with memory management:
  - `addMemory()`: Add new memory point
  - `updateMemoryContent()`: Update existing memory
  - `deleteMemory()`: Remove memory
  - `getTotalMemoryCharacters()`: Track total character count
  - `getMemoriesContext()`: Format memories for AI context
- Modified `ChatProvider` to integrate memory context:
  - Added `_memoryContextGetter` callback
  - Added `_onMemoryExtracted` callback for saving AI-generated memories
  - Memory context is automatically included in all AI requests
  - AI responses are parsed for memory JSON: `{"memory": "..."}`

#### UI Layer
- Created `MemoryScreen` in `lib/screens/memory_screen.dart`:
  - List view of all memories
  - Add/Edit/Delete functionality
  - Character count display with 1000 char limit
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Memory save notification with app logo
- Added "AI Memory" section to Settings screen with:
  - Memory count and character usage
  - Navigation to MemoryScreen

#### AI Integration
- Modified system prompt to instruct AI about memory system
- AI can save memories by including `{"memory": "..."}` in responses
- Memories are automatically extracted and saved (if under 1000 char limit)
- Memory context is prepended to system prompt for all conversations

**Features**:
- ✅ Memories saved as bullet points (max 1000 characters total)
- ✅ Visible in Settings > AI Memory section
- ✅ User can add, edit, and delete memories
- ✅ AI can automatically save memories when learning about user
- ✅ Memories sent with all chat requests
- ✅ Logo displayed when memory is saved
- ✅ Character limit enforcement with visual indicators

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/models/memory.dart`: New memory model
- `lib/services/database_service.dart`: Added memory operations
- `lib/providers/settings_provider.dart`: Added memory management
- `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart`: Integrated memory context
- `lib/screens/memory_screen.dart`: New memory management UI
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`: Added memory section
- `lib/main.dart`: Connected memory callbacks

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Required

1. **App Icons**: Verify icons appear correctly on:
   - Android home screen
   - Windows taskbar and Start menu
   - macOS Dock and Launchpad
   - iOS home screen
   - Linux app menu

2. **Splash Screen**: 
   - Verify custom logo appears and rotates smoothly
   - Check all screen sizes and orientations

3. **Memory System**:
   - Create new memories manually
   - Verify 1000 character limit enforcement
   - Test edit and delete functionality
   - Chat with AI and check if memories are automatically saved
   - Verify memories appear in new chat contexts
   - Test memory save notification with logo

### Known Limitations

1. iOS and macOS icons are generated during build process (requires Flutter environment)
2. AI memory extraction depends on AI following JSON format instructions
3. Memory limit is a hard cap - no partial saves

## Future Enhancements

1. Add memory categories/tags
2. Implement memory search functionality
3. Add memory importance/priority levels
4. Allow memory export/import
5. Add memory analytics (most used, oldest, etc.)
6. Implement memory auto-consolidation when approaching limit
