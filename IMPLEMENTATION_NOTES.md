## Overview
This document describes the enhancements implemented based on the requirements:
1. Add "Think" mode option
2. Add "claudy" model (Claude 4.5 Haiku)
3. Add app animations (splash screen, thinking box, new chat UI)
4. Focus on all types of apps (mobile, desktop, web)

## 1. Think Mode (Deep Reasoning) ‚úÖ

### Implementation Details
- **Location**: `lib/widgets/chat_input.dart`
- **UI Component**: Added "Think Mode" option in the "+" button modal menu
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Toggle switch in AI Options section
  - Green "Think Mode Active" badge when enabled
  - Badge appears with smooth fade-in animation

### Technical Changes
- Added `_reasoningEnabled` state variable
- Updated `ChatInput` widget signature to accept `reasoning` parameter
- Modified `_sendMessage()` to pass reasoning state
- Updated `chat_provider.dart` to accept reasoning parameter

### API Integration
When Think Mode is enabled, the API request includes:
```json
{
  "model": "...",
  "messages": [...],
  "stream": true,
  "reasoning": true  // Added when Think Mode is active
}
```

### User Experience
1. User taps "+" button beside input field
