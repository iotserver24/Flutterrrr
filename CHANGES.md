# Changes Made to Xibe Chat

## Summary
Three improvements have been implemented as requested:

### 1. âœ… Windows Builds for x86 and ARM64
**What was requested:** Build EXE files for both Windows x86 and ARM64

**What was done:**
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to build for Windows ARM64 in addition to x64
- Both architectures now produce EXE and MSIX packages
- Note: x86 (32-bit) was not included because Flutter officially deprecated 32-bit Windows support

**Result:** The workflow now builds:
- `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v{version}.zip` (existing)
- `xibe-chat-windows-x64-v{version}.msix` (existing)
- `xibe-chat-windows-arm64-v{version}.zip` (NEW)
- `xibe-chat-windows-arm64-v{version}.msix` (NEW)

### 2. âœ… AI Typing Animation
**What was requested:** Add AI typing animation when we ask something

**What was done:**
- Added a blinking cursor animation that appears at the end of AI responses while they're being streamed
- The cursor (â–ˆ) blinks smoothly with a fade effect at 530ms intervals
- Only appears during active AI response streaming, disappears when complete

**Result:** Users now see a realistic typewriter effect as the AI types its response, making it clear the AI is actively responding.

### 3. âœ… Image Selection for Vision Models
**What was requested:** When selecting a model that supports both text and image input, provide image selection functionality

**What was done:**
- Added automatic detection of vision-capable models based on their `vision` flag and `input_modalities` array
- Added an image picker button (ðŸ“· icon) that only appears when a vision-capable model is selected
- Implemented image preview with the ability to remove the selected image
- Updated the message system to handle images in OpenAI's multimodal format
- Images are stored in the database and displayed in chat history
- Added database migration to support image storage

**Vision-capable models** (from the provided list):
- gemini, gemini-search
- openai, openai-fast, openai-large, openai-reasoning, openai-audio
- bidara, evil, unity

**Result:** When a vision model is selected:
1. Image picker button appears in the chat input
2. Users can select images from their gallery
3. Selected images show as a preview
4. Messages with images are sent to the AI
5. Images are stored and displayed in chat history

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` - Added ARM64 Windows builds
2. `lib/widgets/message_bubble.dart` - Added typing cursor animation and image display
3. `lib/widgets/chat_input.dart` - Added image picker functionality
4. `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart` - Added vision model detection
5. `lib/models/message.dart` - Added image support with multimodal API format
6. `lib/services/database_service.dart` - Database schema upgrade for images
7. `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart` - Updated to pass vision support flag
8. `pubspec.yaml` - Added image_picker dependency

### Key Features:
- **Backward compatible**: All existing chats and functionality work unchanged
- **Minimal changes**: Only the necessary code was modified
- **No breaking changes**: Existing databases are automatically upgraded
- **Platform support**: Image picker works on all platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Testing the Changes

### Test Typing Animation:
1. Start a new chat
2. Send a message to the AI
3. Watch the AI's response - you should see a blinking cursor at the end while it types

### Test Image Support:
1. Select a vision-capable model (e.g., "gemini" or "openai")
2. Notice the image picker button (ðŸ“·) appears in the input area
3. Click the button and select an image
4. The image preview should appear with an X button to remove it
5. Type a message (optional) and send
6. Both the image and text should appear in the chat
7. Try switching to a non-vision model - the image button should disappear

### Test Windows Builds:
1. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Check that both x64 and arm64 artifacts are produced
3. Download and test the appropriate version for your Windows device

## Notes

- **Database Migration**: When users first open the app after updating, the database will automatically upgrade to version 2 to support images. This is seamless and doesn't affect existing data.

- **Image Quality**: Images are automatically resized to 1920x1920 max and compressed to 85% quality to balance visual quality with API request size.

- **API Compatibility**: The implementation uses OpenAI's standard multimodal message format, which is compatible with the Xibe API.

- **Flutter Version**: All changes work with Flutter 3.0.0+ and use stable APIs.
