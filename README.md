## Configuration

### API Key Setup

The app uses the Xibe API (https://api.xibe.app) for AI responses. You can configure the API key in two ways:

1. **Through the app settings**:
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to Settings (‚ò∞ menu ‚Üí Settings icon)
   - Enter your Xibe API key in the "API Configuration" section
   - Click the save button

2. **Using environment variable**:
   - Set the `XIBE_API` environment variable with your API key
   - The app will automatically use this key if no key is set in settings

If no API key is configured, the app will attempt to use the default configuration.

### Available AI Models

The app automatically fetches available models from the Xibe API. You can switch between models using the robot icon (ü§ñ) in the top right corner of the chat screen. Available models include:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- OpenAI GPT-5 Nano
- DeepSeek V3.1
- Mistral Small 3.2
- Qwen 2.5 Coder
- And many more!
